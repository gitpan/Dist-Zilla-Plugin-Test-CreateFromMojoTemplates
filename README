NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CreateFromMojoTemplates - Create tests from
    custom Mojolicious templates

SYNOPSIS
      ; In dist.ini
      [Test::CreateFromMojoTemplates]
      directory = examples/source
      filepattern = ^\w+-\d+\.mojo$

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CreateFromMojoTemplates creates tests by
    parsing a custom file format containg Mojolicious templates and the
    expected rendering. See MojoX::CustomTemplateFileParser for details.

    It looks for files in a given "directory" (by default "examples/source")
    that matches "filepattern" (by default "^\w+-\d+\.mojo$").

    If you have many files you can also create a "template.test" (currently
    hardcoded) file. Its content will be placed at the top of all created
    test files.
